Project 2: Amazon_Sales Analysis 2025 ðŸ“ˆ

This Python project involved analyzing Amazon product sales data for the year 2025. This project was an insightful learning experience, teaching me how to handle transactional datasets, perform sales trend analysis, and create compelling visualizations to understand product performance.

ðŸ“Š Key Learnings:

âœ… Proficiency in data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas for sales data.
âœ… Identifying top customers by total spending and established correlate between price and quantity using numpy
âœ… Sales trend analysis, including daily, weekly, and monthly patterns.
âœ… Effective data visualization using Matplotlib to represent sales figures and product performance.

I'm excited to use these skills to explore more e-commerce sales data and contribute to a better understanding of consumer behavior and product success on platforms like Amazon.
